# PwC Project   
***Main Hypothesis: How do changes in trust influence Enterprise value ? (Case study for Automotive industry)***  

**First approaches:**    
Using comment section of Youtube videos from selected account (e.g. @AudiDE, @Audi ...) for sentiment analysis and proximity score to  word "trust"  

To be implemented:   
- Expand keywords (quality, innovation, reliability)  -> Problem with the proximity score technique
- Use BERT instead for sentiment analysis  ✓
- Topic Modeling,techniques like LDA to identify topics   (how these topics change over time or how they vary between brands)
- competitors BMW, Mercedes etc ✓ 
- Assess whether higher engagement (likes, replies, or comment volume) correlates with positive or negative sentiment
